This repository serves as documentation and storage for the UW-Stout Capstone project created by Dylan Robens, Austin Weber, Joaquin Sabin, and Alex Shroeder.

These files are provided as is and with no liability, however they are free to be used to recreate the project.

This repository is not meant to be a tutorial, but everything you would need should be documented
